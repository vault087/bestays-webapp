# Property Images Store Integration Task - ✅ CORE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## Overview

Refactor property image management to use the images slice as single source of truth, eliminating dual management between `property.images` and separate image handling.

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ What Works

- Images slice exists with proper file handling, temporary IDs, and cleanup
- Property store includes images slice via composition
- Persistence correctly excludes images (files would be lost)
- Hydration handles legacy base64 cleanup
- Existing `is_new` pattern in `MutableProperty`

### ✅ Issues Resolved

1. **Type Mismatch**: ✅ Fixed - `MutableImage extends DBImage` with browser fields
2. **Broken Logic**: ✅ Fixed - `convertToMutableProperty` works correctly
3. **Dual Management**: ✅ Eliminated - Images slice is single source of truth
4. **Architecture Confusion**: ✅ Resolved - Clean separation of concerns

### 🎯 Target Architecture - ✅ IMPLEMENTED

- ✅ `MutableImage extends DBImage` + browser fields (`is_new`, file handling)
- ✅ Images slice = single source of truth
- ✅ Removed `images` from `MutableProperty` for clarity
- ✅ Initialize slice from `property.images` on mount
- ✅ RPC batch updates using `is_new` pattern (ready for implementation)

## Implementation Progress

### ✅ Phase 1: Type System Unification - COMPLETE

**✅ Checkpoint 1.1: Fix DBImage Schema**

- ✅ Schema was already clean (no `order` field needed removal)
- ✅ Kept `alt` field for accessibility
- ✅ Validated against existing data

**✅ Checkpoint 1.2: Create MutableImage Type**

- ✅ Defined `MutableImage extends DBImage`
- ✅ Added browser-specific fields:
  ```typescript
  interface MutableImage extends DBImage {
    id: DBSerialID; // Unique identifier for slice management
    is_new: boolean; // Track if this is a new upload vs existing DB image
    file?: File; // Original file for new uploads
    previewUrl?: string; // Object URL for file preview (needs cleanup)
    uploadedAt?: Date; // Upload timestamp
    name?: string; // Original filename
    size?: number; // File size in bytes
  }
  ```

**✅ Checkpoint 1.3: Update Images Slice**

- ✅ Replaced `ImageData` with `MutableImage`
- ✅ Updated slice methods to handle both DB images and file uploads
- ✅ Added initialization from `DBImage[]` array
- ✅ Added helper methods: `addDBImages`, `reorderImages`, `getAllImagesOrdered`

### ✅ Phase 2: Store Integration - COMPLETE

**✅ Checkpoint 2.1: Fix Property Store Bug**

- ✅ Verified `convertToMutableProperty` fix (user had already fixed)
- ✅ No additional tests needed at this stage

**✅ Checkpoint 2.2: Remove Images from MutableProperty**

- ✅ Removed `images` field from `MutablePropertySchema`
- ✅ Updated all property form hooks that referenced `property.images`
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing components

**✅ Checkpoint 2.3: Store Initialization**

- ✅ Initialize images slice with `property.images` in store creator
- ✅ Convert `DBImage[]` to `MutableImage[]` with `is_new: false`
- ✅ Handle empty/null images array gracefully
- ✅ Removed legacy image cleanup code from hydration

### ✅ Phase 3: Hook Refactoring - COMPLETE

**✅ Checkpoint 3.1: Update usePropertyImagesInput**

- ✅ Replaced `useState` with slice actions
- ✅ Use `addImage`, `deleteImage`, `getAllImagesOrdered` from slice
- ✅ Handle reordering via slice `reorderImages` method
- ✅ Return combined view: existing + new images as `DBImage[]` for UI compatibility

**✅ Checkpoint 3.2: Dual Image Type Handling**

- ✅ Display existing images (DBImage with URLs)
- ✅ Display new uploads (MutableImage with File previews)
- ✅ Convert between File uploads and DBImage format in hook
- ✅ Handle URL cleanup via slice deletion methods

**✅ Checkpoint 3.3: Component Updates**

- ✅ Updated `PropertyImagesInput` to use new hook signature with `onAddFile`
- ✅ Updated `CompactImagesView` and `ExpandedImagesView` to use slice actions
- ✅ Replaced manual ObjectURL creation with proper slice file handling
- ✅ Maintained existing UI behavior and interactions

### 🚀 Phase 4: Persistence Integration - READY

**⏳ Checkpoint 4.1: Form Submission Preparation**

- 🎯 Ready to implement: Create method to extract final images for submission:
  ```typescript
  getImagesForSubmission(): {
    existingImages: DBImage[];     // is_new: false
    newImages: MutableImage[];     // is_new: true (with Files)
    deletedImageIds: DBSerialID[]; // Track deletions
  }
  ```

**⏳ Checkpoint 4.2: RPC Integration Planning**

- 🎯 Ready for RPC signature design for batch image updates
- 🎯 Ready for File upload handling (separate from batch RPC)
- 🎯 Ready for ID mapping strategy for new images post-upload

### 🧪 Phase 5: Testing & Validation - IN PROGRESS

**⏳ Checkpoint 5.1: Unit Tests**

- 🎯 Need tests for `MutableImage` type conversions
- 🎯 Need tests for slice initialization with existing images
- 🎯 Need tests for hook behavior with mixed image types

**🟡 Checkpoint 5.2: Integration Tests**

- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ✅ Dev server runs without runtime errors
- 🎯 Manual testing needed: add → reorder → delete → submit workflow
- 🎯 Test store persistence and hydration
- 🎯 Test File cleanup on component unmount

**🟡 Checkpoint 5.3: Visual Testing**

- 🎯 Manual testing needed: verify UI displays existing images correctly
- 🎯 Verify File upload previews work with slice
- 🎯 Verify reordering and deletion interactions
- 🎯 Test responsive behavior

## 📋 CURRENT STATUS

### ✅ COMPLETED

- **Core Architecture**: Images slice integrated as single source of truth
- **Type System**: Clean `MutableImage` extends `DBImage` pattern
- **Store Integration**: Property forms use slice actions
- **UI Integration**: Components use `onAddFile` for proper file handling
- **Memory Management**: Slice handles ObjectURL cleanup

### 🎯 READY FOR NEXT STEPS

1. **Manual Testing**: Test image upload/remove/reorder in UI
2. **RPC Integration**: Implement batch upload with `is_new` pattern
3. **Performance**: Optimize for large image sets if needed
4. **Testing**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests

### 🚀 HOW TO TEST

```bash
# Dev server is running at http://localhost:3000
# Navigate to: /[locale]/dashboard/properties-sell-rent
# Test image upload, reorder, delete functionality
# Check browser dev tools for memory leaks
```
